# Wasser Audio Engine

## Hello there

this project is a Audio Engine, that is based in terminal, using the SDL_mixer and the Mini Audio libraries
it works clear and it´s inspired by a project called "Music_Player"

it has to players based on the two libraries used in this project
for those who want a more complete experience, I recommend the SDL_mixer version

to use it, you need to add to the PATH, and after run in the terminal "wasser mixed" it will open it

to see the commands type "help" in the command line

it´s not fully complete, but its functional at least
